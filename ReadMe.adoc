== Browser automation in Clojure

This project show-cases how you can use a pure `clojure REPL` driven approach to browser automation.

=== Salient features of the project

- Utilizes the native clojure implementation of `webdriver` protocol (doesn't rely upon `selenium`) via `etaoin` library.
- Uses simplified dependency management via `tools.deps` for clojure.

=== Setting up the config file

[source,clojure]
----
{:username     "myUserName"
 :password     "myPassword"
 :path-driver  "/usr/local/bin/geckodriver"
 :path-browser "/Applications/Firefox Developer Edition.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox"}
----

== Walkthrough video

In the accompanying video I'll show how to

- Get up and running with the `IntelliJ Cursive plugin` for `clojure`
- A brief introduction to the capabilities of `etaoin` library.
- A walkthrough of the code as well as the execution flow.
